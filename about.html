    <p class="pet"> All available pets are currently listed on 24PetConnect under the “Adopt” section.

      If you are interested in adopting a cat or kitten, please feel free to come to the Animal Welfare and Adoption
      Center and walk through our available cat rooms. No appointment is needed in order to adopt or view the available
      cats and kittens.

      If you are interested in adopting a dog or puppy, you are more than welcome to visit the Animal Welfare and
      Adoption Center and view our available dogs and puppies in their kennels. If you would like to interact and adopt
      we do require an appointment. An appointment is needed so that we can provide our undivided attention to you and
      your potential new family member. Appointments are in 30 minute increments and are scheduled same day only. In
      order to schedule an appointment, we will need either the Animal ID number or the name of the dog you are wanting
      to see. Please feel free to call 850-595-3075, or walk in and make your appointment.

      All available pets are on a “First come, First serve” basis and are not able to have a “hold” placed on them for
      adoption. </p>
