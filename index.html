      <p class="pet">
        Armstrong County is committed to working in partnership with the community to create a safe, healthy and caring
        environment for both citizens and animals. We promote citizen safety, responsible pet ownership, and education
        in the reduction of animal over population. The Armstrong County Animal Shelter is located at 200 W. Fairfield
        Drive. The Animal Welfare and Adoption Center averages around 300 animals in our care at any given time, with
        several
        coming and going each day. Due to the volume of animals and changing population we are unable to identify any
        animal over the phone or by email. Please come to the facility to identify your lost pet
      </p>

    <h1 class="gro"> Lost pet.</h1>
    <p class="pet"> If you have a missing pet. Please the Armstrong County Animal Services and the “I Lost A
      Pet” section. If we have or you think we have your pet, you will need to come to the shelter with proof of
      ownership. Proof of ownership can include pictures of your pet, vaccination records, identifying marks on your
      pet, tags and/or microchips. If your pet is indeed at the shelter you will need your state issued identification
      card or drivers’ license in order to redeem. There will also be a fee associated with the redemption which varies
      with every pet, based on vaccination status, length of stay and other factors. (Please see the fee schedule for
      more details.)
